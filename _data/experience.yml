      until: June 2017
      summary: >
        Implemented phase field model for solid-state transformation in alloy systems with three
        components and four phases, analogous to Inconel 625. Designed initial conditions based on
        electron micrographs of additively manufactured Inconel 625 to simulate microstructure
        evolution during heat treatment. Produced thermodynamic models through simplification of
        quantitative CALPHAD databases while retaining key phase diagram features, using computer
        algebra systems to accurately generate expressions and multivariable derivatives for import
        into phase field software.
