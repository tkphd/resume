    thesis: Bias in Polycrystal Topology Caused by Grain Boundary Motion by Mean Curvature
    summary: >
      Performed large-scale phase field simulations of normal isotropic grain growth on high
      performance computing clusters including AMOS, an IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. Designed and
      implemented algorithms to reconstruct polyhedral grain topology (faces, edges, and vertices)
      from diffuse interfaces in 2D and 3D phase field datasets. Found the process of triangular face
      elimination responsible for biasing topology in populations of polyhedral grains in synthetic,
      simulated, and real metal microstructures.

    thesis: Effects of Magnesium(II) on Zinc Oxide Nanorod Growth From Aqueous Solution
    summary: >
      Designed experiments to deposit ZnO on glass substrates using a novel flow-through aqueous
      chemical reactor. Found minor effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions on ZnO film stress and lattice
      parameters.
