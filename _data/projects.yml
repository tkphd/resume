  start: 2013
  until: Present
  summary: >
    MMSP is an open source library for phase-field and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations written in
    C++ with MPI. Invited to join project as co-developer based on contributed patches to eliminate
    memory leaks and resolve race conditions in parallel computing environments. Eliminated
    corruption in parallel I/O on large-block filesystems, enabling clean execution of phase field
    and kinetic Monte Carlo research simulations on IBM Blue&nbsp;Gene/Q supercomputers with up to 4096
    cores. Implemented testing of proposed source code changes through automatic online continuous
    integration.
